Name Validator and Quadratic Solver

EXERCISE 1
Write a simple function named nameValidator that takes in name as an argument and validates the argument using the following constraints:
•	Must be a string which is a combination of two substrings, each representing first name and last name respectively, Ex. "John Doe"
•	Must only contain alphabets and a single space character that separates the first and last name substrings.
•	The length of the first and last name substrings each must be >= 5 characters and <= 20 characters.
For each of the constraints defined above, print an error message to the user with a meaningful text when the constraint is violated. Else it should print “Validation successful”.

EXERCISE 2
Write a simple function named quadraticSolver which uses the quadratic formula in the image below to compute the root of quadratic equations.

 

Brownie Points: While writing the logic for this function, ensure to handle the zero-division exception that may be raised when the value of argument "a" is zero.
